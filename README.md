# Historic-code-PC-Pascal-and-ASM-
It's amazing what you find when you retrieve a box of floppy disks from the attic!

This is stuff I wrote or modified from other sources in the 1980s and 1990s. It might as well live on somewhere!

RockEd - An MSDOS map editor for the Rockford PC game from the 1980s. Written in Turbo Pascal (probably 5.5 or 6)
QT - the 'Qute Time' MSDOS program that displays the current time in words. Modified from the original code written by the late, great Jim Button. ASM86.

More to come, but don't get too excited!
