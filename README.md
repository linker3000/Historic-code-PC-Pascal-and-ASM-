# Historic-code-PC-Pascal-and-ASM-

It's amazing what you find when you retrieve a box of floppy disks from the attic!

This is stuff I wrote or modified from other sources in the 1980s and 1990s. It might as well live on somewhere!

* RockEd - An MSDOS map editor for the Rockford PC game from the 1980s. Written originally in Turbo Pascal (probably 5.5 or 6), the version here has been successfully recompiled on Windows 10 in both DOSBOX and FreeDOS running in VirtualBox - see the notes at the top of the source code if you fancy having a go - or try the pre-compiled .EXE (Win 10 / DOSBox). IMPORTANT: This editor only works with the original version of the game. There is a later version (somewhere out there on the 'net that's playable in an online emulator) that was based on a newer game engine; it looks identical but clearly stores the game maps in a different format and this editor doesn't work with it...but feel free to modify the code to fix things. Let me know if you do!

* QT - the 'Qute Time' MSDOS program that displays the current time in words. Modified from the original code written by the late, great Jim Button. ASM86.

More to come, but don't get too excited! Everything here is released into the public domain. No support or guarantees that the code is complete.
